# ToDoListSwift

Welcome to iTask - the task app made using XCode and SwiftUI

iTask was a great project that enabled me to learn a number of fundamental SwiftUI concepts:

- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture
- User Interface: Stacks, Spacers, Modifiers, Multiple Views, Linking between Views, Seemless UX, conditional display.
- CRUD functionality: Add task, toggle complete, change list order, delete task.
- Persisting Data: encoding and decoding JSON
- Animations, Launch Screen, App Logo
- Responsiveness: iPhone & iPad, Light & Dark mode

## Video Demonstration

## XCode learning experience

Learning XCode has been an exciting journey, and with just 10 days prior to this being written, I had no experience using the XCode IDE. Since then, I've gotten to grips with how to make a fully functioning app. Here are some of the key learning points:

- Use of the canvas preview
- The device simulator
- File and folder organisation
- SwiftUI files
- Storyboards
- Connecting XCode repo to Github & commiting changes
- Understanding of the Swift Programming language (syntax) and the XCode library 

## Deploying to the App Store

If I were to deploy this app to the app store, these are the steps I would take:
