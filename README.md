# ToDoListSwift

Welcome to iTask - the task app made using XCode and SwiftUI

iTask was a great project that covers a number of fundamental concepts.

- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture
- Model
- View: Modifiers, Multiple Views, Linking between Views
- ViewModel
- Building User Interfaces
- CRUD functionality
- Persisting Data: encoding and decoding JSON
- Animations, Launch Screen, Logo
- Responsiveness: iPhone & iPad, Light & Dark mode

## XCode experience

Learning XCode has been an exciting journey, in which just 10 days prior to this being written, I had no experience on the IDE. Since then, I've gotten to grips with how to make a fully functioning app. Here are some of the key learning points:

- Use of the canvas preview
- The device simulator
- File and folder organisation
- SwiftUI files
- Storyboards
- Connecting repo to Github & commiting changes
- Understanding of the SwiftProgramming language and the XCode library
