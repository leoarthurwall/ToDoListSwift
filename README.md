# ToDoListSwift

Welcome to iTask - the task app developed using XCode and SwiftUI.

iTask was a great project that enabled me to learn a number of fundamental SwiftUI concepts:

- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture
- User Interface: Stacks, Spacers, Modifiers, Multiple Views, Linking between Views, Seemless UX, conditional display.
- CRUD functionality: Add task, toggle complete, change list order, delete task.
- Persisting Data: encoding and decoding JSON
- Animations, Launch Screen, App Logo
- Responsiveness: iPhone & iPad, Light & Dark mode, Portrait & Landscape orientation.

## XCode learning experience

Learning XCode has been an exciting journey, and with just 10 days prior to this being written, I had no experience using the XCode IDE. Since then, I've gotten to grips with how to make a fully functioning app. Here are some of the key learning points:

- Use of the canvas preview
- The device simulator
- File and folder organisation
- SwiftUI files
- Storyboards
- Connecting XCode repo to Github & commiting changes
- Understanding of the Swift Programming language (syntax) and the XCode library

## Deploying to the App Store

If I were to deploy this app to the app store, these are the steps I would take:

1. Create an iOS distribution provisioning profile and distribution certificate.
2. Create an App Store Connect record for the app.
3. Archive and upload the app using Xcode.
4. Configure the app's metadata and further details in its App Store Connect record.
5. Submit the app for review.
6. Check on the status of your app (fingers crossed it is successful)!

Each step goes into further detail, and the process is well documented online. So for the sake of keeping the readme concise, I will keep the steps as a high-level overview.

## Other SwiftUI Projects

With no experience with SwiftUI or XCode, my plan was to gain as much exposure as possible. So I took on a number of tutorials and projects, and layered the skills and experience. Here are links to my other SwiftUI projects, in case you'd like a glance at my 10-day SwiftUI journey. All the repos can be found on my GitHub profile too.
